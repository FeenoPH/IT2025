In object oriented programing, important objects are defined by various classes, which each have their own properties as per the object they represent.
For instance, a program written to manage attendance in a classroom might define a class for people, which includes their age, name, and role in the classroom.
These roles might then be represented by student and teacher classes, with properties for students including GPA and classes, and properties for teachers including classes taught.

The __init__ method in python is used when creating a new object, which is a new instance of a class. 
It allows the programmer to initialise the attributes of the instance upon its creation.
For instance, when creating the previously mentioned attendance program, the __init__ method would be used to define the attributes like age name and role

The self keyword is used by an object to refer to its attributes as opposed to the attributes of the entire class.
For instance, in the previously mentioned attendance program, the self keyword would be used to view the attributes of a specific student or teacher.
